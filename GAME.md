# Airside active brief

## Vision

Airside is a real-time, persistent airport management game for Mac. The player designs and manages the system while aircraft, passengers and ground services operate automatically. Watching the airport work should be satisfying, and every delay should have an understandable cause.

## Current milestone

Phase three: keep the airport operating between sessions. The prototype now writes versioned local saves, records priority-crew decisions, advances the same deterministic simulation for elapsed real time and shows a welcome-back report with completed flights, cash change and delay costs. A corrupt latest save falls back to the previous complete copy.

## Invariants

- Domain and simulation rules remain independent of Unity scenes.
- Time comes from an injected clock.
- Random choices come from a seeded source.
- Runways, taxiways and stands must be reserved before use.
- Frame rate must not change simulation outcomes.
- No external data or asset enters the project without a recorded licence.

## Run it

Open `game/Airside` in Unity 6.3 LTS and press Play.

- Space: pause or resume simulation
- Tab: switch between 1× and 4× time
- Right-drag: orbit camera
- Scroll: zoom
- WASD: pan overview
- F: follow aircraft
- O: return to overview
- P: hire a priority turnaround crew while the aircraft is at stand

Run checks with `scripts/test-unity.sh`. Build the local Mac app with `scripts/build-mac.sh`.

## Current evidence

- Sixteen edit-mode tests pass.
- A fifty-cycle simulation completes without reservation conflicts.
- Large and one-second time steps reach identical simulation state.
- Turnaround dependencies, disruptions, priority crews and delay costs are covered by tests.
- Continuous play and offline replay produce matching operational and financial state.
- Save recovery, backward clock handling and a bounded thirty-day absence are covered by tests.
- The project compiles in Unity 6.3 LTS on the development Mac.

## Next work

Replace the single visual path with a named taxi graph and record operational transition events. Then run a longer visual soak before introducing a second simultaneous aircraft.
